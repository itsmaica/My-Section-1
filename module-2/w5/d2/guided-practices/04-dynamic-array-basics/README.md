# Practice Dynamic Arrays

Your task is to implement the constructor, `read` and `unshift` function on a Dynamic Array.

You may use brackets to access values in your data like `data[i]` but no other built-in
JavaScript array methods. You cannot use [unshift][mdn-unshift] to implement your `unshift`.

## Instructions

1. Download the starter using the link below.
2. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.
4. Run `npm test` to run specs.
5. Implement the `DynamicArray` constructor, `read` and `unshift` methods until all specs
   are passing.
