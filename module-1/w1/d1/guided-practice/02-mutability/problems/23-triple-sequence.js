/*
Write a function tripleSequence that takes in two numbers, start and length. The
function should return an array representing a sequence that begins with start
and is length elements long. In the sequence, every element should be 3 times
the previous element. Assume that the length is at least 1.
*/

// Your code here 


// console.log(tripleSequence(2, 4)); // [2, 6, 18, 54]
// console.log(tripleSequence(4, 5)); // [4, 12, 36, 108, 324]
