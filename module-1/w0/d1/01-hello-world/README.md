# Hello World!

Welcome to an App Academy coding project!

Anytime that you open a coding project, run the following command to install
dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

Then, follow the prompts in the block of instructions at the top of every
problem file in the __/problems__ folder of the project.

To run your code in a problem file, run the following command in your terminal
and replace `<problem-file-name>` with the name of the problem file:

```sh
node problems/<problem-file-name>.js
```

For example, to run the first problem file in the __/problems__ folder, run the
following command in your terminal:

```sh
node problems/01-console-log.js
```

To test your code in a problem file with the given test specifications, run the
following command in your terminal and replace `<problem-file-name>` with the
name of the problem file:

```sh
npm test test/<problem-file-name>-spec.js
```

For example, to test the first problem file in the __/problems__ folder, run the
following command in your terminal:

```sh
npm test test/01-console-log-spec.js
```

To run all tests, use this command:

```sh
npm test
```

You know you are done with this coding project when all tests pass with green
check marks in your terminal!

Have fun coding! ðŸ˜Š
