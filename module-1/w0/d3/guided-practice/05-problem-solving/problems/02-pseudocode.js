/*
Problem Statement:
Given a number, write a function called within5Of100 to return true if the given
number is within 5 of 100.
*/

// console.log(within5Of100(94));  //=> false
// console.log(within5Of100(95));  //=> true
// console.log(within5Of100(100)); //=> true
// console.log(within5Of100(105)); //=> true
// console.log(within5Of100(106)); //=> false
