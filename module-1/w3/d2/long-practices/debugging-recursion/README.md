# Debugging A Stack Overflow

Uh oh! We've written a recursive function in the `problems/recursive-debug.js`
file, but it's throwing an error! Investigate the included problem and see if
you can figure out what's going on.

Make sure you're in the project's root: you should be in the same place as the
`test/` directory. Once there, run the following setup command:

```sh
> npm install
```

Whenever you want to test your code, run the following command:

```sh
> npm test
```

If you get stuck, step back and try breaking the problem down. Are we missing 
any key steps for a recursive function?

When the tests pass and the error is gone, take a minute to celebrate - you're 
officially a recursion debugger!
