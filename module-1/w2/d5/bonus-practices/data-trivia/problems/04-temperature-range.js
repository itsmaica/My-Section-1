/* `temperatureRange` - What is the temperature range for each month in each
city?

In this case, temperature range is the difference in temperature between the
high temperature and low temperature in a given month ( range = high - low ).

Write a function, `temperatureRange` that takes in the climate data, and returns
a new copy of the array that includes all of the city data. Each city object
should have a "monthlyTemperatureRange" key that points to an array of objects
formatted to match the example output below:

[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "city": "Amsterdam",
    "country": "Netherlands",
    "monthlyTemperatureRange": [
        { "month": "January", high: x, low: x, range: x },
        { "month": "February", high: x, low: x, range: x },
        // ... continued for all 12 months
    ]
  },
  // ... constinued for all cities in the original climateData array
]:

Note: You can solve this in multiple ways. Try using a few advanced array
methods. Can you use helper methods to separate out the logic?

function temperatureRange(climateData) {
