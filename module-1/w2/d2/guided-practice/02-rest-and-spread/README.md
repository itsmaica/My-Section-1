# Rest and Spread Practice

## Usage

1. Download the starter
2. `cd` into the folder and `npm install` to install dependencies
3. `npm test` to run all specs
4. Your objective is to implement the functions in the __/problems__ folder to
   pass all specs

## Running the specs for each problem

To run specs only for a single problem, you can add the file location of the
test file that corresponds to the problem that you want to test. For example,
if you want to test a file called __problem/`<file-name>`.js__ file only, you
can run __npm test test/`<file-name>`-spec.js__.

## Submission

When you are ready to submit:

1. **Delete the `node_modules` directory**
2. Zip up your folder
3. Upload it
