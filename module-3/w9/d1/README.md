## The rendering engine
  * After a network response is made to a server and a response is sent back, the rendering engine begins to parse the HTML response and display that content in the browser.

### `Constructing the DOM`
  * The first step in the rendering process is the construction of the DOM.
  * When the `HTML` is received,
  * the rendering engine parses the `HTML` and constructs the `Document Object Model`, which is commonly known as the `DOM`.
  * The HTML is converted into `nodes`, which form the `DOM tree` (i.e. a hierarchy of nodes).
    * We know trees!
    * Each node in the tree is a `HTML element`


### `DOM VS BOM`
### Browser Object Model
- Interacting with the Browser
    - Hierarchy of browser objects
    * `Consists of Navigator object` - Information about the browser itself
    * `Window object` - The main browser window/ chief browser object
      * can access different properties on the object including:
        * `window.navigator`
        * `window.screen`
        * `window.history`
        * `window.location`
        * `window.document` - This is our DOM
    * `Document object`

### Document Object Model
- Interacting with the document
  - ie: manipulate HTML elements
    - The `DOM` contains a collection of `nodes` `(HTML elements)`, that can be accessed and manipulated
    - `DOM` is a web page
    - Represents the hierarchy that document
    - The `DOM` is created after the `HTML` file is loaded.

    * The `window object` is the core of the `BOM`
    * We access the document object through the `window object`
    - `window.document`
    - can also just use document
